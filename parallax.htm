        <p class="text">
          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky.Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are
          often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to
          achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only
          be obtained by such activities.
          <br /><br />
          Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,which can be
          interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some
          people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According
          to adventurer Andr√© Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is
          not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?"

        <p class="text">
          Biking is a great way to enjoy adventure, as it allows you to explore
          new places, challenge yourself, and have fun. Biking can be done on
          different terrains, such as roads, trails, mountains, or deserts,
          depending on your preference and skill level. Biking can also be done
          solo or with a group of friends, making it a versatile and social
          activity.

          <br /><br />
          Biking can improve your physical fitness, as it works your
          cardiovascular system, muscles, and bones.It can reduce your stress,
          as it releases endorphins, the feel-good hormones, and helps you
          relax1

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport that
          allows you to fly in the air using a paraglider, which is a wing-like
          structure attached to a harness. Paragliding is a motor-free and
          engine-less sport that requires courage and decisiveness. Paragliding
          can give you a thrilling and exhilarating experience, as you can soar
          through the skies and enjoy the breathtaking views of the landscapes
          below.
          <br /><br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br /><br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing.
